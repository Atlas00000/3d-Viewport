# 🐛 Bug Fix Summary - Infinite Loop Issue

## Problem
The application was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error caused by an infinite re-render loop in the main component.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `useEffect` that was adding objects to history on every render:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
useEffect(() => {
  if (sceneObjects.length > 0) {
    addToHistory(sceneObjects)
  }
}, [sceneObjects, addToHistory])
```

The `addToHistory` function was being recreated on every render because it depended on `historyIndex`, which changed every time it was called, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution

### 1. Removed Automatic History Management
- Removed the problematic `useEffect` that was adding to history on every render
- Added manual history management in specific action handlers

### 2. Updated Main Component
```typescript
// FIXED: Manual history management in action handlers
const handleAddBox = useCallback(() => {
  const id = generateId()
  const name = generateName("box", sceneObjects.length + 1)
  const newObject = createBox(id, name)
  addObject(newObject)
  selectObject(id)
  // Add to history after object creation
  addToHistory([...sceneObjects, newObject])
}, [addObject, selectObject, sceneObjects, addToHistory])
```

### 3. Updated Hooks
- **`useSceneObjects`**: Added `setObjects` method for manual state management
- **`useSceneHistory`**: Changed initial `historyIndex` to -1 to indicate no history

### 4. Added Initialization Control
```typescript
const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isInitialized && sceneObjects.length === 0) {
    initialSceneObjects.forEach(obj => addObject(obj))
    setIsInitialized(true)
  }
}, [addObject, sceneObjects.length, isInitialized])
```

## Benefits of the Fix

✅ **No More Infinite Loops** - Fixed the re-render issue  
✅ **Better Performance** - History is only updated when needed  
✅ **Manual Control** - History is managed explicitly in action handlers  
✅ **Cleaner Code** - Removed problematic automatic history management  

## Files Modified

1. **`app/page.tsx`**
   - Removed problematic `useEffect`
   - Added manual history management in action handlers
   - Added initialization control

2. **`hooks/useSceneObjects.ts`**
   - Added `setObjects` method for manual state management

3. **`hooks/useSceneHistory.ts`**
   - Changed initial `historyIndex` to -1

## Testing
- ✅ Server runs without infinite loop errors
- ✅ Application loads successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ History management works correctly

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Avoid `useEffect` with dependencies that change on every render
- Use manual state management for complex operations
- Test for infinite loops during development
- Keep dependencies minimal in `useCallback` and `useEffect`

The application now runs smoothly without any infinite loop issues! 🎉
