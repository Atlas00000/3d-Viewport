# 3D Explorer Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan follows the **Development Commandments** to refactor the 3D Explorer project with a focus on:
- **Quick wins** for immediate improvement
- **Modularity** for maintainability
- **No overengineering** - simple, effective solutions
- **Functionality first** - core features working well

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)

### 1.1 Extract Core Hooks (High Priority)
**Goal**: Separate business logic from UI components

**Files to Create**:
```
hooks/
├── useSceneObjects.ts      # Scene object management
├── useObjectSelection.ts   # Selection logic
├── useSceneHistory.ts      # Undo/redo functionality
├── useLighting.ts          # Lighting controls
└── useCamera.ts           # Camera controls
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduce main component size by ~60%
- Improve testability
- Enable reuse across components
- Better separation of concerns

### 1.2 Split Main Component (High Priority)
**Goal**: Break down the 1,055-line monolithic component

**New Structure**:
```
components/
├── scene/
│   ├── SceneViewport.tsx      # 3D canvas and rendering
│   ├── SceneControls.tsx      # Sidebar controls
│   ├── ObjectProperties.tsx   # Selected object editing
│   ├── LightingControls.tsx   # Light management
│   └── CameraControls.tsx     # Camera reset/controls
├── 3d/
│   ├── SceneObject.tsx        # Individual 3D object wrapper
│   └── SceneEnvironment.tsx   # Environment and lighting setup
└── ui/
    └── (existing UI components)
```

**Benefits**:
- Each component has single responsibility
- Easier to test and debug
- Better code organization
- Reduced cognitive load

### 1.3 Remove Duplicate Components (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Clean up redundant selection logic

**Actions**:
- Remove `SelectableMesh.tsx` (unused)
- Consolidate selection logic in `SelectableWrapper.tsx`
- Ensure consistent selection behavior

**Benefits**:
- Eliminate confusion
- Reduce maintenance burden
- Single source of truth for selection

### 1.4 Improve Type Safety (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
onPointerOver: (event: any) => void

// After
onPointerOver: (event: ThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void
```

**Benefits**:
- Better IDE support
- Catch errors at compile time
- Improved developer experience

## Phase 2: Modular Architecture (Week 2)

### 2.1 Create Scene Management Service (High Priority)
**Goal**: Centralized state management without overengineering

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// services/sceneManager.ts
export class SceneManager {
  private objects: SceneObject[] = []
  private history: SceneObject[][] = []
  private historyIndex = 0

  addObject(object: SceneObject): void
  updateObject(id: string, updates: Partial<SceneObject>): void
  deleteObject(id: string): void
  undo(): void
  redo(): void
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Centralized state logic
- Easier testing
- Better performance
- Clear data flow

### 2.2 Implement Error Boundaries (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Graceful error handling without complexity

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
export class SceneErrorBoundary extends Component {
  // Simple error boundary for 3D scene
  // Fallback to basic scene on error
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents app crashes
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging

### 2.3 Add Loading States (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Better UX for async operations

**Implementation**:
- Loading spinners for model uploads
- Progress indicators for large operations
- Skeleton states for UI components

**Benefits**:
- Improved user feedback
- Better perceived performance
- Professional feel

## Phase 3: Performance Optimizations (Week 3)

### 3.1 Implement React.memo (High Priority)
**Goal**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// components/scene/SceneObject.tsx
export const SceneObject = React.memo(({ object, onSelect, isSelected }) => {
  // Component implementation
})
```

**Benefits**:
- Better performance with many objects
- Reduced CPU usage
- Smoother interactions

### 3.2 Optimize Material Updates (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Efficient material property changes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// hooks/useMaterialOptimization.ts
export const useMaterialOptimization = (material) => {
  // Debounced material updates
  // Batch property changes
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Smoother material editing
- Better performance
- Reduced GPU load

### 3.3 Add Object Pooling (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Efficient object creation/destruction

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// utils/objectPool.ts
export class ObjectPool {
  // Reuse objects instead of creating new ones
  // Especially useful for frequently created objects
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Better memory management
- Faster object creation
- Reduced garbage collection

## Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (Week 4)

### 4.1 Add Keyboard Shortcuts (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Power user features without complexity

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts
export const useKeyboardShortcuts = () => {
  // Delete: Delete selected object
  // Ctrl+Z: Undo
  // Ctrl+Y: Redo
  // Escape: Clear selection
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster workflow
- Professional feel
- Better accessibility

### 4.2 Improve File Upload UX (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Better model upload experience

**Implementation**:
- Drag and drop support
- File type validation with preview
- Progress indicators
- Error handling with retry options

**Benefits**:
- More intuitive interface
- Better error feedback
- Professional upload experience

### 4.3 Add Scene Export/Import (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Save and load scene configurations

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// utils/sceneSerializer.ts
export const exportScene = (objects: SceneObject[]) => {
  // Export to JSON
}

export const importScene = (json: string) => {
  // Import from JSON
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Scene persistence
- Share scenes between users
- Backup functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── scene/           # 3D scene components
│   ├── controls/        # UI control components
│   └── ui/             # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── services/            # Business logic services
├── utils/               # Utility functions
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/           # Application constants
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `SceneViewport`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useSceneObjects`)
- **Services**: camelCase (e.g., `sceneManager`)
- **Types**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `SceneObject`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for hooks and services
- **Component tests** for UI components
- **Integration tests** for 3D scene interactions
- **Focus on behavior, not implementation**

### Documentation Requirements
- **README updates** for each phase
- **Component documentation** with usage examples
- **API documentation** for services
- **Migration guides** for breaking changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Breaking changes**: Implement feature flags
- **Performance regression**: Monitor with benchmarks
